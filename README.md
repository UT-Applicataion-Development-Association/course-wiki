### Github Issue
If you have a github account, then you can write a note by opening the issues on the navigation bar on the top of this github repository.  We have already provided
the template for writing a note in the github issue.  The github provides an easy-to-use online markdown editor, after you finish write the issue, you can submit 
the issue.  We will merge this into the website, after you submit your issue.

### Pull Request
You can also fork this repository and work on your own, if you want to submit multiple notes at once.  After you have done your work in your forked repository, you
can submit a pull request in the github.  We will merge your pull request in the later.

### Send Us an Email
If you do not want to create your github account, you can also download the [template](template/template.md) to your machine.  And send your note to our email, we will merge
it into the website after we receive the email.
