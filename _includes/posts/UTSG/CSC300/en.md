## Course Introduction
The full name of CSC300 is "Computer Science & Society", which is mainly to study the role of some long-standing philosophical concepts in today's era of big data and how they affect high-tech products. This course is not a CS course that people traditionally understand, but more similar to a liberal arts course. In this course, students do not need to code, design programs or algorithms, but need to think about how ancient philosophy and modern technology are combined.

The theme of the first week of the course is ethics and morality. It will discuss how to define a thing as good or bad, and how people will make choices under different moral concepts. The content of this part is an introduction, so that students can quickly have a general understanding of philosophical thinking. It is also the only content of the whole semester that has nothing to do with technology and is purely philosophy.

In the following courses, you will learn how philosophy and modern technology are combined. After taking this course, you may be surprised to find that two things that seem to be completely unrelated, their connection can be seen everywhere in our lives, as large as the energy-saving products promoted by technology giants and the recycling of resources. Even the concept of equality in the age of technology, as small as personal data privacy, the copyright of the code, and how each individual is monitored by "data".

## Professor(s)
Ishtiaque Ahmed

Ahmed started teaching CSC300 in Winter Semester in 2018, and he has this course in every semester thereafter. It has been almost 3 years, so he is very familiar with the content of this course. Ahmed is very patient in class and very detailed. He is happy to answer questions and even encourage students to participate in discussions.

## Course difficulty
This course is relatively simple in general. The content of the course is much simpler than other 300 Level CS courses. The only problem may be that the workload is relatively large.

Before class every week, students are required to read 2-3 reading and a case study, and then they will ask a few questions about the case. Next, students need to write a reading response, using the philosophical concepts in reading to explain and answer these questions. Each reading response accounts for 6% of the total score. There are 11 reading responses in total, among which the 9 with the highest scores are taken, which account for 54% of the total score.

For the two-hour lecture per week, the content is actually the content read before class. The difference is that compared to the dry and sometimes difficult text in reading, the lectures of the professor will have more details and easier to understand. If you don't understand or miss anything, you can review the professor's ppt to catch up after class.

After the lecture, there will be a one-hour tutorial. In the tutorial, TA will take the students to review the content taught in the professor's class, and then use what they learned this week to do a case study. This case study is similar to reading response, but it is a group work. Each of the tutorial case studies accounted for 2%, and there were 11 tutorials in total. The 8 with the highest scores were selected, which accounted for 16% of the total score.

Although both Reading Response and Tutorial are written content, TA is more concerned about whether students understand the philosophical content and whether they think about the questions raised, so the English grammar problem that foreign students are worried about is actually not a big problem in this course. As long as the TA can understand what you mean, know that you are thinking hard and have your own opinions.

Finally, the final exam accounts for 30%, and the exam takes two hours. The final exam has two main parts. The first part is a conceptual multiple-choice question, the situation includes single choice, multiple choice and judgment; the second part is a essay question, there are conceptual discussions and case studies.
