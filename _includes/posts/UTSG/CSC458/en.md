## Course Information
The existence of the internet has significantly changed people's life.  Meanwhile, in the history of software engineering, the network was one of the most complex software.  The main content of the CSC458 is introducing network architecture.  The course concentrates 
on the link layer, network layer, and transport layer, as well as the protocols in every layer.

The central goal of the link layer is to enable communication among a local area, this type of network is known as the local area network.  Currently, Ethernet is the dominant protocol used in the wire-local area network.  CSC458 will cover the principle of how hosts 
communicate with each other through Ethernet including Ethernet frame format, arp 
protocol, CSMA/CD protocol, etc.

The network layer is built based on the link layer.  The network layer enables cross-region 
communication among hosts.  The IP protocol is the most important one in the network layer.  
Also, a main topic in the network layer is the routing.  Since there are potentially many regions across hosts, the IP protocol needs to find the correct path among hosts.   The 
mechanism of the IP protocol and different routing protocols will be covered here.

The transport layer is the extension of the network layer and also it is the crucial one for current network communication.  The network layer supports cross-region communication among hosts,  whereas, there are potentially many running processes on both hosts.  The transport layer provides a gateway for communication among different hosts.  One of the most well-known protocols in the transport layer is TCP.  The basic principle behind TCP and 
various extensions of the TCP will be discussed in the course.

CSC458 does not only teach the network architecture but also content like Middlebox, 
Security, and Software-defined network.
