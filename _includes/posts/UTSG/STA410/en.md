## Course Introduction

Here you will learn: rounding error analysis + running time analysis from computer science, optimization from calculus, eigenvalues + eigenvectors from linear algebra, denoise, random generation + least squared regression from statistics.

Many things are mentioned by the prof without talking in depth, just comes up with the conclusion.  Do not tell you how to use it and do appear in the exam even.  

However, in general, it is considered to be a course to get mark easily in the fourth year of the statistics.
