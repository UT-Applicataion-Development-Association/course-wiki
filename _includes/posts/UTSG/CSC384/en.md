## Course Introduction
CSC384 is the introduction of AI, but this AI may be a bit different from the AI expected by many people. Now, AI stands for very cool products, such as automatic translation, speech recognition, etc. But these are the areas expanded by the current development of AI,
The original AI design is actually just a software that has a lot of computing power to exhaust the problem and find the best solution to the problem, and this is the AI that CSC384 will introduce. The essence of AI is actually to find the optimal solution through searching, but with the complexity of the problem, the search and the strategy of AI will become different.
CSC384 will focus on 4 strategies related to AI searching, namely basic search, multi-agent search, constraint satisfaction and probabilistic reasoning. Finally, CSC384 will explain the knowledge representation, that is, how to transform knowledge that humans can understand into a form that computers can understand.

Basic Search is a relatively basic content. It is built on the background of single agent without constraints. It includes BFS, DFS, Heuristic Search and A* Search, as well as the deformation of these algorithms such as path checking, cycle checking, etc.

Multi-agent is a strategy to be performed when more than one agent performs a zero-sum game, and the most commonly used algorithm is the minimax algorithm. One drawback of minimax is that it searches for all possible but many of them may not Appeared in the game,
in order to reduce the amount of search, a necessary technique is pruning, a classic algorithm that adds pruning to minimax is alpha-beta pruning

Constraint Satisfaction is when the agent needs to search in the context of constraints (for example, no repetition is allowed in Sudoku). The focus of CSP is how to choose under the constraints and when the agent enters a dead state, the agent needs to perform the backtrack.

Probabilistic Reasoning allows the agent to choose according to the probabilistic model, and here it will involve the knowledge of probability, bayes network and hidden markov chain.

## General course design

- Term Test

- Final

## Professor(s)
Fahiem Bacchus: Fahiem is a very knowledgeable and very kind grandfather. He uses a lot of slides for each class, but all the content will be placed on slides. Basically, you can refer to slides whether it is exam review or homeworks.  Homework and exams are relatively fair.

## Course difficulty
CSC384 may betray expectation for many people, but the AI techniques it describes are still available today, such as minimax, pruning, backtrack. The content is non-abstract and not complicated.  The exams are fair.
