## Course Introduction
DRM101 is centered on the key concepts of three drama disciplines: the definition of drama, stage display and performance research.

In this course, students are asked to consider some drama elements in daily life and discuss the application of performance issues in life. Drama in life is considered the most basic performance, and it is also the foundation for students to think about performance in cultural, social, political and other aspects.

## General course design
2 hours of lecture per week and 1 hour of tutorial.

Attendance and Participation- 20%

- As long as you attends the activity, you will get the mark, but it does not clearly state the weighting for each tutorial.

In Class Writing Exercises- 15%

- A total of 5 Exercises, 3% each. As long as you write this part carefully, you can basically get full marks. The only problem is that the professor will not say in advance when there will be a writing exercise. He will tell you to write one in the middle of the class, and the content is related to what she said in the class that day, so you must participate in lecture.

Library Research Assignment- 10%

- First read the script of a short play. Students need to search for resources related to the theme of the script. There are more than a dozen resources in total. The requirements of these resoruces are different. For example, some are related to the historical background of the script, some are related to the core concept of the script, and some are related to the character of the main character. Students need to summarize the resources and discuss these connections.

Director's Show Essay- 20%

- After the students watched a drama directed by a senior Drama student, they were asked to write an essay to discuss some of the director's decisions in the drama. These decisions need to have an important impact on the display of the performance, such as why the character has a specific behavior, such as the role of the stage setting and lighting in rendering the storyline, etc.

Final Exam- 35%

- Standard liberal arts exams, write a few essays.
