## Course Introduction

**Microeconomics**, with individuals as the research object (for example: a single producer/consumer). Mainly learn about the operation of market mechanisms, the generation of commodity prices, and the effective allocation of resources. This lesson requires a lot of graphical analysis (drawing) and quantitative analysis (calculation).

This lesson has a lot of definitions, formulas, and rules. If you want to get a high score, you must memorize it thoroughly, because basically every chapter is related. It is recommended to keep reading the textbook, go to the tutorial, do exercises, and often go to the office hour if possible. Generally speaking, the content of this lesson is not particularly difficult, but it requires you to spend a lot of time to familiarize and memorize the content of the course and understand the teacher's questioning routines. The teacher's questions are usually very winding, so try to brush as many questions as possible and then analyze the rules of the questions.

The quiz is generally a calculation question or multiple choice question. Be sure to pay attention to the decimal point and addition and subtraction signs. The big test is generally a big question, including calculation, drawing, analysis, etc. (high probability should be given some countermeasures according to the situation given by the teacher, and you need to explain or prove your countermeasures). There is still a lot of homework in this class, and writing accounts for more than 50%.

The average course score is mostly between 60% and 70%, **not a water class**.

## General course design
For reference, the following is the curriculum for 2020 Winter:
-Entry Task (1%)
-5 Term Assessments (52.5% each)
-Tutorials (10%)
-Topic Quizzes (16%)
-Packback Participation (10%) (writing assignment)
-Final Assessment (10.5%)

## Permanent Professor
-Prof. Gazzale: Commonly known as God G, the exam questions are really horrible, but the lectures are still very clear.
-Prof. Farhoodi: A slightly gentler way of making questions, as long as you have enough practice questions, there is no big problem.

## Course difficulty
As long as you are willing to spend time learning, you can still get a good score. The homework is not difficult, mainly because the exam is more difficult, but it is also divided into teachers. It is said that some prof like to ask the original questions, but the questions of God G are generally more complicated.

-Content difficulty: 3.5/5

-Homework difficulty: 2.5 / 5

-Workload: 3/5 (This does not include the time needed to invest independently if you want to get a high score)

-Overall difficulty: 4/5 (This refers to the difficulty of the course for which you want to get a high score. If you just want to overshoot 63%, it should be 3-3.5)

The dividing line mentioned here is the dividing line into the Economics Major, but it should be noted that some higher-level ECO courses have higher requirements for this course. For example, if you want to take the course ECO206, then you must take 70% or more of ECO101.
