## Course Introduction
CSC236 generally continues the content of CSC165, emphasizing the skills of mathematics and logical proof and its application in the field of computer programs. The whole semester can be divided into three parts: Inductions, Finite State Automata and Regular Expressions, Algorithm Analysis.

Inductions: Based on Simple Induction, it derives Complete Induction, Structural Induction, and Principle of Well- Ordering. These methods are all tips and tricks in the follow-up certification process of this course.

Finite State Automata is a mathematical model that describes the behavior of a finite number of states and transitions between them. This course focuses on the design and definition of FSA; its specific purpose will be more reflected in CSC258. Regular Expression is used to describe a syntax rule, such as the format of date and time. This course focuses on designing regex, proving regex equivalence, and regularity proof.

Algorithm Analysis can be subdivided into
Recursive/Iterative Program Correctness Proof: Use Induction to prove whether the recursive or iteration in the program achieves the expected result.
Recurrence Runtime Analysis: Calculate a recursive runtime with a calculation formula.
Divide- and- Conquer Algorithm: Divide a big problem into several sub- problems, analyze and merge them into the final result in turn.
