## Course Introduction
CSC301 is developed by a large team project as the main line. The weekly content of this class is about the various knowledge that needs to be understood in the formal development process. Soft skills have project planning, project management. Hard Skill includes git,
unit testing, DAO, REST. However, the lecture only talks about the concept about them, you will gain better understanding through working on the assignments. At the same time, the project of this class is not a small one like 207, but a project that really exists in Party A. At the beginning of class,
there will be a large project list. These are provided by the partner company. Each group chooses the project that they want to do. They have to meet with Party A every week to communicate the progress, and then the development of the project will also require various details Writing deliverable is used to judge the score. Finally, at the end of the semester, the team and partners will be required to present their projects.

## Professor(s)
David Jorjani: David has basically taken over CSC301 for the past few years. He has been working as a developer for a long time, and now he has his own company, so he has a deep understanding of the development. He is a very approachable person, but his homework is sometimes a little overwhelming, but the mark is not bad.

## Course difficulty
CSC301 can be said to be a stepping stone to development. The curriculum of CSC301 allows you to truly experience how a project development is like. Knowing this in advance is helpful to people who want to engage in development in the future. Although CSC301 is not mention, but, it is recommended to come to this class after taking CSC309 and CSC343, because this class is not a class that teaches you how to write codes. You need to ensure that you have enough background. CSC301's homework is all related to working on full-stack apps, if you donâ€™t have enough before
It may take a lot of time for self-study, so I recommend everyone to come back after finishing 309 and 343.
