## Course Introduction
Strictly speaking, Computational Linguistic is more like an application of CS in linguistic. It is somewhat different from Natural Language Processing but also has a certain similarity.
Many places now include Computational Linguistic into Natural Language Processing. CL is mainly an analysis of language structure and function in linguistics. Simply put, it is to use the program to see that the text you write does not conform to the grammatical context and logic.
CSC485 can be understood as half of the grammar class, reviewing the grammar of natural languages, and the other half explaining the corresponding CS knowledge such as parsing, word sense disambiguation, syntactic ambiguity,
ambiguity resolution and so on.

## General course design
- 3 Programming Assignments (33% each)

## Professor(s)
Gerald Penn: In the past few years, Penn has taken up the CSC485 course alone. He is a very knowledgeable person. He often speaks languages of other countries in the class. Of course, he also has a good CS background. He welcomes students to ask questions and will give you hints on homework.

## Course difficulty
Generally speaking, the content delivered in the lecture involves far more than you really need to work on the assignment. The homework is not particularly difficult.
- Content difficulty: 3.5/5

- Homework difficulty: 3/5

- Workload: 3/5

- Overall difficulty: 3/5
