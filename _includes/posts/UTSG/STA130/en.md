## Course Introduction

The year I attended this course was the first time it offered. At that time, the pace of teaching was rather chaotic, but the prof quickly adjusted it.
Generally speaking, it is a very beginner-friendly course. If you plan to take other sta courses later, or just come to understand what sta is, it is very recommended.
It contains a wide range of content, it will mention some sta concepts, hypothesis testing, regression, CI, etc., it will also include a certain R coding, and there is a very detailed R tutorial (other than STA130, other sta courses in the university will not teach you how to write R step by step).
In particular the tidyverse package. Knowing the tidyverse will help you prepare for data wrangling and data visualization.
