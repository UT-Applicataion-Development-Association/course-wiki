## Course Introduction
Macroeconomics, looking at the economy from the perspective of the entire country (the main analysis object is the government), includes topics such as international trade and finance, the role and definition of money, the banking system, monetary policy, and fiscal policy.

This course is very similar to ECO101, and there are many theories, definitions, formulas, rules, etc. that need to be remembered. I personally think that the theory of macroeconomics is better understood than the micro, but the macro requires stronger logical thinking because it often requires analysis of examples. The drawing in this lesson is a lot of calculations. But in the same way, as long as you spend time reviewing, reading textbooks, writing questions, going to tutorials, and asking questions, you can get a good score. There will be more writing in this class than ECO101.

The curriculum of this course is also a small test calculation or multiple-choice questions, a big test big question (calculation 30%, drawing 20-30%, small text 40-50%). The small essays in the big questions (usually five big questions, 3-5 small questions for each big question) also need to analyze a case or explain a phenomenon. Some definitions are usually asked in the big questions, so be sure to memorize them well. But generally speaking, if you can make a reasonable explanation for the analysis you give, even if it is not completely correct, it will give you some points, so the process/explanation is very important.

## General course design
For reference, the following is from 2021Fall:
-3 Midterms: 50%
-6 Quercus Quizzes: 10% once every two weeks
-6 Assignments: 10% once every two weeks
(If it is Brandt's class, it is usually writing articles, 500 words)
-Final: 30%

## Permanent Professor
-Prof. Brandt: Homework is usually writing. The questions are quite satisfactory, as long as you keep in mind the theory and definitions, you can answer at least 70% of the questions in the general exam. The lectures are rather unreliable, and I often get confused when listening. The speech is like a bb machine with no emotions, but overall it is good. Note here that Brandt and Gazzale will diverge on a certain definition (I forgot which one is specific), but I prefer Brandt's definition.

-Prof. Gazzale: Similar to the description in ECO101, the questions are very convoluted, so you need to brush more questions.
-Prof. Farhoodi: The questions are similar to Brandt, and the lectures may be a little clearer.
## Course difficulty
There is nothing difficult in the world, as long as you are willing to work hard! ! ! In the same way, as long as you are willing to spend time, you can definitely get a good score. But another phenomenon is that I think macro is easier to understand than micro, but the score of macro is generally lower. This is definitely different from person to person, but I think it might be because I didn't study macro seriously when I was in the second semester. Also, macro needs logical analysis and requires you to be proficient in applying various theories. You must know how to draw a picture, otherwise the big test will be gg.

-Content difficulty: 3/5 (here refers to if you want to understand the content)

-Homework difficulty: 3/5 (Writing is generally to summarize some articles and then need to combine some learned theories, but from the perspective of difficulty, it is really good, but it is more time-consuming)

-Workload: 4/5 (The article is more time-consuming, and then the demand for reading textbooks in 102 is slightly larger than that in 101)

-Overall difficulty: 4/5 (According to my experience, it may take 4.5 to get a high score, especially because I may enter a state of exhaustion after studying 101 and 102, or it may just be that I have this problem.)

If you simply want to exceed 63%, the difficulty may be 3.5, but if it is more than 70%, the difficulty is probably 3.5-4 and then higher.
