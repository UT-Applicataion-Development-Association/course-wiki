## Course Introduction
Compared with code, CSC207 pays more attention to the overall design and different ways for implementing the feature of the program, in order to write an extensible and easy-to-read program. Students will be divided into groups and use git to go through several phases under the guidance of TA to complete a project throughout the semester.

At the beginning of the course, self-study of the Java language is required; on the basis of the corresponding CSC148 content, the details of inheritance are expanded and the Abstraction, Interface, Memory Model and Exceptions.

The focus of the course is to understand the significance, advantages and disadvantages of Clean Architecture and SOLID Design Principles in program design and learn how to properly use several Design Patterns to optimize program structure.

Clean Architecture is a model that divides programs according to the functions the modules are responsible for. Reasonable program segmentation (such as kernel-terminal) makes the module functions clearer and can effectively improve the reusability and scalability of the program.

SOLID Principles are 5 guiding principles that should be considered when designing a program. The core lies in how to correctly use polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation, interfaces and other methods to make the program cleaner, safer, and expandable.

Design Patterns are some optimal solutions for common functions summarized by predecessors, such as iterator, strategy, adaptor, and so on. These patterns can often make programming more effective.

In the meantime, the course will also introduce CRC, uml, javadoc and other tools used for teamwork and expressing program functions, code smells that should be avoided during programming, the use of Regular Expression, and floating point problems.

## Course difficulty
The content of the course is relatively fragmented, and it is necessary to have a detailed understanding of each concept, associate it with reality, and apply it flexibly to the project. Of course, reliable teammates are also vital to the project.
