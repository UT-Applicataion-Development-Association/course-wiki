## Course Introduction
CSC318 is a very specialized course, and also a very alternative CS course, because this course does not require students to write any code. Starting from the 200 Level CS class, students are required to design their own projects, and then use codes to implement their ideas, such as CSC207, CSC209, etc. This course focuses more on the design perspective, requiring students to spend a whole semester to design a project and display it.

In the first and second year of the CS class, students will be directly told what kind of project to do and what features to make. The design steps have been completed determined by the professor and TA, and the students only need to fulfill the professor's requirements. This course will allow students to have direct contact with users. Students need to take a good user experience as their first goal, conceive what kind of project users need, and think about what features they want to make. And finally designed this project.


## General course design
The core content of this course is user experience, and the course design of this course is a complete product development process.

In CSC318, students need to build a group of 6 people and spend a whole semester to complete a product development.

The content of the first part is project establishment. The students were asked to find a problem in their lives. For the remaining of the semester, they will design a product based on this problem. This product can be an app or a website, but no matter what format it is, it needs to be able to solve the problems they first discovered.

The content of the second part is research and market research. First of all, students need to find materials (library books, research papers, news reports, etc.) to prove that the problems they find should cause people's attention. Next, students need to conduct market research, using interviews, questionnaires, observations, etc. to get people's views on the issues they select.

The content of the third part is preliminary design. Through the second part of the market research, students should be able to make the questions they choose more concrete, and at the same time they should better understand who the potential target users of their products are, and what features these potential users need most. Next, students will combine these features together to become the prototype of the product.

The fourth part is about product testing and improvement. At this stage, there should be 2-3 full-lecture product tests. During the 3 hours of lecture time, students will take their classmates as potential customers and design a set of procedures for them to test their product models. All problems that arise during the testing process, such as why users understand the testing process incorrectly, and why users have different understandings and expectations of the product, need to be recorded. Next, the students will have 1-2 weeks to improve their project and solve the problems that appeared in the previous test.

The content of the fifth part is display. Students need to make a 10-minute presentation to summarize how they have derived from the initial question to the final product model since this semester. The way of this presentation is more diverse, you can live presentation or record a video summary.

Each part of the above description actually includes 1-3 assignments. The reason why this course is not specifically discussed here is that the calculation method of this course is a bit confusing. Some assignments need to be written in report, some assignments need to be prototyped, and some assignments are also divided into group mark and individual mark, and the proportion follows the marking scheme There will be changes in the changes. You can go to see syllabus after class for specific content, and there will be a very detailed introduction above.


## Professor(s)
IIona Posner

Professor Posner has been teaching this subject at UT for more than ten years, and she is also very famous in the field of Human Computer Interaction, and has done User Experience Consultant for many large companies including Apple Canada and Bell Canada. Since Professor Posner's resume is too rich and wonderful, I won't say more here. If you are interested, you can go to her personal website and check it out by google ILONA POSNER.

Professor Posner is a person who loves work very much. Perhaps the most interesting example is that during the epidemic last year, Professor Posner discovered that the airline’s epidemic prevention measures were not perfect during a business trip. She wrote a letter of complaint specifically to discuss where the other party’s epidemic prevention measures need to be corrected. Finally I found myself a job. In the course CSC318, she also encourages students to find good & bad design in their lives, and then submit it to her on quercus. Before every class, she will show these designs and ask the students who submitted the designs to come up and explain their ideas.

## Course difficulty
Although the product development process is a long and complicated process, the professor will explain in detail what students need to do at each step in the lecture. For each assignment, there will be 2-3 pages of instructions. From what is the purpose of the assignment, why the assignment is important, how to count, how to submit, how to submit, what is the name of the submitted file, what format, and various information Everything.

In summary, the content of this course is not difficult, and the course content is also very detailed. The marketing mainly depends on whether the TA recognizes your final project, whether they can accept your design philosophy, and whether they understand the decisions you made in product development, but overall the score in this course is still good.

- Content difficulty: 3/5
