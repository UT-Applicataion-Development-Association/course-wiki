## Course Introduction

The entire course is about Bayesian. The models learned are: generalized linear model, generalized linear mixed model (random effects), generalized additive model, geostatistics model. Many of them overlap with other sta300/400 level courses, but it seems that geostatistics does not have much overlap with other courses.

All assignments are about essays. You need to include the following modules: introduction, abstract, method, result, discussion, appendix. The good news is that most of the coding part in the assignments are written by prof and only need to modified slightly to complete the work.

## General course design

- 4 assignments

    - Each assignment contains a one-page essay and a two-page essay.

- final

    - The final exam will require you to write part of the essay (for example, let you write the method part alone, or let you write the results+discussion part), and some will let you write a complete essay directly on the spot.
Anyway, this course is inseparable from essay.
