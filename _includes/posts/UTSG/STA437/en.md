## Course Introduction

STA437 contains excessive content about matrix including eigenvalues, positive definite, etc,. Most of them will be covered in other courses, such as MLE. Probably, the new content introduced in this course is the PCA (principle component analysis).

## General course design
- 5 tests 16% each

    - One hour for each test.

- 20% final

## Professor(s)

M Molkaraie

The lecture is conducted in the form of video, and the proof will be taken out separately to make a video. Will publish the answers to practice questions

## Course difficulty
If you have the basis of MAT224, the Linear Algebra part of STA437 will be relatively simple, if not, then congratulations, you have to struggle for a while
