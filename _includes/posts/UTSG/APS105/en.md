## Course Introduction
APS105 is a C language programming course for the first year of engineering. It mainly teaches programming ideas from scratch. In addition to learning some basic concepts, the focus of this course is on the completion of each LAB. LAB not only requires the use of learning content, but also introduces the project splitting ideas often encountered in engineering and the complexity and efficiency issues that need to be considered in the future. As the saying goes, programming itself is not difficult, and it is tormenting people to come up with good algorithms.
