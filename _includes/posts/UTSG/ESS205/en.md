## Course Introduction

There are a lot of overlaps with ENV200,but cover more in depth compare to ENV200. You need to do a little reading and write quiz every week, and finally you need to make a poster and present it.

## General course design
- weekly reading quiz

- poster

- final
    - We did the final for two hours, and then gave us an hour to discuss on the spot (yes, it was in the exam center)
