## Course Introduction

A specialist course, and perhaps the most difficult statistics course. Covers content from statistical models (order statistics, standard errors, etc.) to point estimation, interval estimation (Bayesian & frequency school) to a variety of hypothesis tests.

## General course design

Three homework (easy to medium difficulty), one midterm (a huge difficulty for the 2021 winter semester, I hope to be a personal next year), and one final (medium easy).
