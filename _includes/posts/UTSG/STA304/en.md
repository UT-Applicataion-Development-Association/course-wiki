## Course Introduction

Generally everyone takes it as a bird class

***But I heard that the 2021 fall has been reformed, the content has become difficult, please refer to the evaluation of 2021 fall and later***

STA304 contains a lot of knowledge about sampling and survey, such as the required sample size, how to calculate the variance, how to do the test, where there is bias, etc.
This course is not very related to other sta courses, so it is unlikely to help you prepare for other sta300/400 courses.
But personally speaking, it is a  practical course, because now many companies will need some sampling-related knowledge for doing market research.  Learning this course may be helpful in the workplace.
