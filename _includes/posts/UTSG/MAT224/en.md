## Course Introduction

MAT244 is the follow-up of mat223, but it is much more difficult than mat223. Many people with 90+ of mat223 did not get high scores in 224. The course average is also relatively low, and the drop rate in the year I joined was as high as 70%. The students collectively protested and deleted posts on piazza. If you just want to keep your GPA, skip this course. If you want to learn something, please read on.

This course contains a very comprehensive and very solid linear algebra. If you want to develop in math or sta in the direction of math based, I still recommend it. It can lay a good foundation for many subsequent courses.
In terms of personal experience, basically many courses require mat223 as the prerequisite will involve a bit of mat224. Learning mat224 well may benefit you from the entire university (ignore this, if your major does rely on the linear algebra).
