## Course Introduction
***Because I am on a section of a Korean professor, this review is only for Korean professors***

***If your prof is not a Korean professor, please ignore this review automatically***

A class that makes people doubt life.
prof: "Even the second year graduate content may not understand the content. I hope you can learn knowledge from me. If you want high scores, please go to other sections."
