## Course Introduction
Database is an indispensable component in the back-end of large apps. CSC343 is an introductory course for database. CSC343 mainly talks about three things Relational Algebra, SQL and database design.

Relational Algebra is the formalization of Database in mathematics. It expresses a relation by using set. Different symbols represent different operations such as select, project, join, etc.
We can operate on different relations through different symbols to get the results, this series of operations is also Relational Algebra.

After Relational Algebra, CSC343 will introduce the syntax of SQL (Structured Query Language) and how to use SQL to create relations and write queries to obtain data. How to use jdbc (database in java
driver) create database connection and interaction in java

The last unit of CSC343 is about how to design a database. The part involves a lot of theory stuff such as functional dependency, lossless join, two commonly used database paradigms BCNF and 3NF and corresponding algorithms, and ER (Entity Relation) graph

## Professor(s)
Diane Horton: Diane is the resident professor of this class. You can see her teaching this class every year. The quality of Diane's lectures is quite guaranteed, and she is a very good professor.

Mark Kazakevich: Mark is a relatively young professor. The slides he uses in class are basically Diane's slides, but lectures are also not bad

## Course difficulty
CSC343 is actually not a particularly difficult class, but this class is an introductory class for students who want to learn development. People who want to find a development job in the future recommend to finish CSC343 as soon as possible. After all, this class only requires 207. It can be arranged in the winter semester of the second year.
