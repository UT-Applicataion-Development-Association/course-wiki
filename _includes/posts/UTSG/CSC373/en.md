## Course Introduction
CSC373 is the theory course in the last two compulsory courses in CS Specialist. CSC373 took over CSC263 and continued to follow CLRS. The focus of CSC373 is the explanation and proof of various algorithms including Divide and Conquer, Greedy Algorithm,
Dynamic Programming, Network Flow, Linear Programming, the PNP problem, and approximation algorithm for the NP problems.

Divide and Conquer is a common way of solving problems, which is to decompose the problem into many small problems and merge the solutions into the solution of the original problem by solving each small problem.

Greedy Algorithm is usually used to solve the problem of maximizing/minimizing the objective. The final solution is obtained by selecting the intermediate objective each time greedily. But Greedy does not guarantee that the solution obtained will always be optimal, so there is Dynamic Programming.

Dynamic Programming is essentially similar to Divide and Conquer, but Divide and Conquer has a problem that it repeats calculations for recurring problems.
In Dynamic Programming, a technique called memoryization is used to remember the solutions of recurring problems so as not to repeat calculations. However, how to design DP algorithms and use data structures for memorization is the most difficult part of DP.

Network Flow is a graph problem. Each edge stores the flow capacity from one point to another. The problem that Network Flow studies is how much flow can be transported from the source point to the end point in a graph. Various algorithms and max-flow min-cut theorem are introduced

Linear Programming is a kind of optimization problem, given a linear function and corresponding constraints, trying to find a solution that can maximize/minimize the function. This will involve the property of duality and the use of simplex to solve linear
programming

PNP is one of the most famous problems in CS theory. It is also one of the seven problems in the millennium (that is, the most difficult way to earn 1 million in human history). The main direction of PNP is complexity. We can solve many problems. This type of problem that can be solved by polynomial time is called type P problem.
But at the same time, there are many problems that we don't know whether they can be solved in Polynomial, which is the so-called NP problems, and this includes NP, NP hard, NP complete, the core of the PNP problem is whether P and NP Equal (this problem has not been solved yet).
A side note, Stephen Cook who raised the issue of PNP is also a professor at UofT but has recently retired

Approximation is to use some algorithms for some NP problems so that they can get an approximate solution (but not an accurate solution) in polynomial time as a reference

## General course design
- 3- 4 Written Homework

- Term Tests

- Final

## Professor(s)
Francois Pitt: Francois is currently one of the few people who have completed all the theory courses from first year to third year. His feedback in class is good and the lectures are very clear, but the exam and homework will be difficult

Nisarg Shah: Nisarg is the youngest of the 373 professors.  He is very willing to help students, and the difficulty of homework and exams is relatively moderate.

Allan Borodin: Allan is a veteran in the theory group. He is a very knowledgeable person, but he is not a good professor. He often talks and starts to talk about many things beyond the scope.
As a result, everyone has no idea what he is talking about and his control of the difficulty is not very good. It is not recommended to go to Allan's 373

## Course difficulty
As the last theory compulsory course of CS Specialist, CSC373 can indeed be said to be a ceiling difficulty course. The content is very abstract and it takes time to understand. At the same time, homework and exams are very focused on the understanding and application of knowledge.
And it requires a certain divergent thinking. It is a lesson that takes a lot of time to learn. Strongly **not recommended** taking with course with CSC369 in the same semester
- Content difficulty: 4.5/5

- Homework difficulty: 4/5

- Workload: 4.0 / 5

- Overall difficulty: 4.5 / 5
