## Course Introduction
This is the only computer hardware course for CS undergrad. From transistors to logic gates, to CPUs and memory, a course from the most basic currents all the way up to describe how electronic components are combined to achieve mathematical and logical operations and construct a CPU, and then show it for humans to read at the end. How is the assembly language converted into a mechanical code composed of 0 and 1. The weekly Lab spends a lot of time on the circuit (During the epidemic, Lab uses Logisim software, and Final Assignment uses assembly to write a game).
