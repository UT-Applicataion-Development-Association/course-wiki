## Course Introduction
This class of CSC324 focuses on the entire subject of Programming Language, rather than introducing the grammar and usage of a specific language like many first year and second year classes. CSC324 uses Racket and Haskell as an entry point also use languages such as
Python, Java, Javascript as examples for introducing the common points and different functionality existing in many Programming Languages. Usually CSC324 will involve three big topics, namely Functional Programming, Macro and Type System.

Functional Programming is actually not a very new topic, but in recent years functional language has taken the lead, and many languages have also begun to migrate some features from functional languages.
The core idea of Functional Programming is to use function and recursion to solve problems without changing any values. This contradicts to the traditional imperative paradigm.
CSC324 will introduce many functional programming features for solving problems such as pattern matching, structural recursion, tail-call elimination and the most commonly used high-order function

Macro is another very powerful function in functional programming. The most common usage of Macro is to declare some constant, type and function definitions like many of us have already seen in C.
Macro in Functional Programming is more powerful than Macro in C, and Macro in Functional Programming can even write a language from scratch. CSC324 will introduce the usage of Macro and use Macro to write OOP,
A lot of OOP mechanisms will be introduced midway, such as how an Object resolves instance attribute and instance method, and why many OOPs need to use self or this to distinguish different instances.
Finally, the course will introduce a little knowledge about declarative programming

Type System is an indispensable function in modern languages. Types exist in the most of modern languages other than assembly. CSC324 will briefly introduce the definition of Strong/Weak Typing, Dynamic/Static Typing, and the importance of types.
Among them, CSC324 will review Polymorphism through Haskell's Type System to explain the significance of Polymorphism to the design of a type system in a language. In the middle, it will involve an important concept in Functional Programming, Monad.

## Professor(s)
David Liu: Basically, there are very few CS students who haven't seen D Liu until the third year. Most of you have been taken care of by him in the first year. In recent years, D Liu has been in charge of the CSC324.
D Liu's teaching skills and course quality are very guaranteed, and he has inherited his usual good habits and wrote a very detailed note for the course.

Albert Lai: Albert is a professor from UTSC. He personally prefers Haskell so that he spends more than half of the class dealing with Haskell. At the same time, the delivery of his lectures is not very good, Do not really recommend Albert for the course

Gary Baumgartner: Gary is a veteran professor of CSC324. Occasionally, He will teach the course during the term which D Liu does not teach the course. He personally prefers to use Racket. Basically, are the course material are written in the Racket

## Course difficulty
CSC324 is not a difficult lesson in general, but many of the content is relatively abstract, and you need to have a good understanding to digest it. The workload of CSC324 is fairly moderate, which is very helpful for content understanding. The CSC324 exam is relatively not particularly difficult.  As long as you follow the course, you should not need to worry about the exam.

Generally speaking, this class of CSC324 is recommended for everyone. This class can provide you with a different perspective to look at the problem and have a new understanding of the programming language.

- Content difficulty: 3.5/5

- Homework difficulty: 3.5 / 5

- Workload: 3/5

- Overall difficulty: 3.5 / 5
